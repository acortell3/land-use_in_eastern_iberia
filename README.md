# Land Use in Eastern Iberia
Data and R markdown script supporting paper by W. Cegielski et al, titled: A Multi-method Approach with Machine Learning to Evaluating the Distribution and Intensity of Prehistoric Land Use in Eastern Iberia, submitted to Quaternary International 25 January 2023.

## Data files include:
* lithic surface collections from surveys in 3 study areas: medland_survey2014_2017.csv
* lithic assemblages from excavation, dated contexts in eastern Iberia: training_data_E_Iberia.csv. These data were used for training the Random Forest model used for chronological unmixing
* radiocarbon dates from eastern and southern Iberia used for SPD analysis: C14_S&E_Iberia_all.csv
* R-Markdown script to carry out Random Forest analyses and generate age estimates of assemblages, and SPD (summed probability distribution) analysis of radiocarbon dates from eastern and southern Iberia: land-use_in_E-Iberia.Rmd
* HTML output file of analyses carried out with R-Markdown script: land-use_in_E-Iberia.nb.html
